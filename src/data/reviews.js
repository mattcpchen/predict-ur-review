  "They charging my card 4 separate times for one night totaling -- and whoever I spoke to about it gave me a terrible attitude",

  "Don't stay here. The street noise is deafening, all night. You need to be on the 14th floor or higher and on the backside of the hotel (Rooms in the XX20's (like 1420). Really cheap windows make sleep an impossibility unless you have the right room.",

  "Location and price are good. Computer use in the basement. Purified water in the gym. However, Upon check-in we were not told about how to access wi-fi. We went back to them to ask Upon check-in we were also not informed that we needed to spend $30.00 a day there as we would be charged $30.00 a day whether we used it or not.",
